<a name="objective" class="anchor" href="#objective"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objective</h2>

<p>This elective course is concerned with understanding when and why cooperative behavior between organisms (including humans) can evolve. This is interesting from an ecological and philosophical perspective, but has also important practical applications, for example for understanding when and why a shared resource will be subject to the tragedy of the commons. </p>

<p>Goals for the participants are </p>

<ul>
<li>To understand the now classical works of evolutionary game theory that explain when and why organisms such as plants or animals including humans can evolve cooperative strategies</li>
<li>To Learn the technical skills for describing the competition of alternative strategies under evolution with mathematical and computer models.</li>
<li>Reproduce the result of classical modeling studies in evolutionary game theory (project work)</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="prerequisites" class="anchor" href="#prerequisites"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>All necessary technical skills will be taught in the course, computer affinity is a bonus, but no prior knowledge of programming or special mathematical skills are required.</p>

Expect homework for the afternoon, we have to get you all on the same level! Thereafter, two weeks equivalent of project work for reproducing a classical paper of evolutionary game theory (a list of paper suggestions will be provided in the course). We will probably schedule a meeting for the whole group with presentation of the work in progress on Friday, 13.12. (second week).</h2>
