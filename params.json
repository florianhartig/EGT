{"name":"Evolutionary Game Theory","tagline":"Lecture notes for MSc Course on Evolutionary Game Theory, Uni Freiburg","body":"### About this course\r\n\r\nThis elective course is concerned with understanding when and why cooperative behavior between organisms (including humans) can evolve. This is interesting from an ecological and philosophical perspective, but has also important practical applications, for example for understanding when and why a shared resource will be subject to the tragedy of the commons. \r\n\r\nGoals for the participants are \r\n\r\n* To understand the now classical works of evolutionary game theory that explain when and why organisms such as plants or animals including humans can evolve cooperative strategies\r\n* To Learn the technical skills for describing the competition of alternative strategies under evolution with mathematical and computer models.\r\n* Reproduce the result of classical modeling studies in evolutionary game theory (project work)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Important links for participants\r\n\r\n* [Syllabus](https://github.com/florianhartig/EGT/blob/master/syllabus/Syllabus2014.pdf?raw=true) - timetable and room information for the course\r\n* [Campus management](https://www.verwaltung.uni-freiburg.de/lsfserver/rds?state=verpublish&status=init&vmfile=no&publishid=136698&moduleCall=webInfo&publishConfFile=webInfo&publishSubDir=veranstaltung) - the course description in the course catalog of the university\r\n* [Ilias page]() - course material will be posted here\r\n\r\nQuestions / contact: [Florian Hartig](http://www.biom.uni-freiburg.de/mitarbeiter/hartig)\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\nAll necessary technical skills will be taught in the course, computer affinity is a bonus, but no prior knowledge of programming or special mathematical skills are required.\r\n\r\n### Course format\r\n\r\n1 week of introductory lectures in evolutionary game theory and programming in NetLogo. Expect homework for the afternoon, we have to get you all on the same level! Thereafter, two weeks equivalent of project work for reproducing a classical paper of evolutionary game theory (a list of paper suggestions will be provided in the course). We will probably schedule a meeting for the whole group with presentation of the work in progress on Friday, 13.12. (second week).\r\n\r\n### Grades\r\n\r\nStudents may work on the assignment in pairs (recommended), but they can also work alone if they chose to do so. We will assign compulsory, but ungraded homework in the first week; the final grades will based on the written report of the project work only.\r\n\r\n### Software\r\n\r\nAll software needed for the course is free and can be installed on personal laptops. We recommend installing the following programs\r\n\r\n* Netlogo (IBM environment) http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/\r\n* R (Plots and Stats) http://www.r-project.org/\r\n* JabRef (Literature DB) http://jabref.sourceforge.net/\r\n* And either word, libre office or Latex as text processing software\r\n\r\n## Further readings\r\n\r\n* [Game Theory II: Advanced Applications (at Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/course/gametheory2)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
