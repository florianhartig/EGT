{"name":"Evolutionary Game Theory","tagline":"Lecture notes for MSc Course on Evolutionary Game Theory, Uni Freiburg","body":"### About this course\r\n\r\nThis elective course is concerned with understanding when and why cooperative behavior between organisms (including humans) can evolve. This is interesting from an ecological and philosophical perspective, but has also important practical applications, for example for understanding when and why a shared resource will be subject to the tragedy of the commons. \r\n\r\nGoals for the participants are \r\n\r\n* To understand the now classical works of evolutionary game theory that explain when and why organisms such as plants or animals including humans can evolve cooperative strategies\r\n* To Learn the technical skills for describing the competition of alternative strategies under evolution with mathematical and computer models.\r\n* Reproduce the result of classical modeling studies in evolutionary game theory (project work)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Important information for participants\r\n\r\n**PRELIMINARY INFORMATION:**: because questions have accumulated in the last days: the exact schedule is not fixed yet because we have to coordinate rooms and people, sorry.
